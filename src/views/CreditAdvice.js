          So this part is basically targeted towards people living in the United States but will apply to other countries as well depending on their Credit system and credit card rewards. 
      <br /> <br />
      In order to survive in life, you have to pay for stuff and there are 3 ways you can pay:
      <ul>
<li>Cash (Venmo, Cash App, check, online transfer)</li>
<li>Debit Card</li>
<li>Credit Card</li>
</ul>
<br />
Using cash and Debit cards is waste of points which means its waste of money.
<br /> <br />
Only Credit cards reward you to spend money. But getting credit cards really depends on your credit history. For this only reason I will use credit cards but the benefits I will list below will blow up your goddamn minds. For starters, what can you do of these rewards, basically you get different type rewards:
<ul>
  <li>Cashback</li>
<li>Airline/ Hotel miles</li>
<li>Credit card reward points (Amex MR, Chase UR): which you transfer to different hotels and airlines.</li>
</ul>
Basic rule of Credit cards: Never spend on anything if you canâ€™t afford and always pay your balance every month (best is to set it up on Autopay).
<br /> <br />

So every dollar you spend, you get points for that depending on what credit card you use. Like a travel card will give more points on travel expenditures, dining, etc. A business card will give extra points for business stuff and a grocery card will give extra points on grocery store purchases. You can use these points to do a lot of stuff. So the next question is do we need to pay for these cards? The answer is yes and no. Some basic cards don't have any annual fee but some cards do like my favorite card of all time Chase Sapphire Reserve which charges $550 every year. Most people don't get a card just after hearing the fee and that's why it's a premium credit card but I will tell you I got this card when I was a student getting paid $12/ hour, why? Because of the benefits, so what are these crazy benefits?
<ul>
<li>$300 travel credit every year</li>
<li>Priority Pass Lounge membership (over 1400 lounges all over the world)</li>
<li>Reimbursement for your TSA Precheck / Global Entry (for foreigners living in USA) which is $100 for 5 years</li>
<li>Primary Rental insurance (I have used it in Europe, 100% cost covered, they paid $1200)</li>
<li>Lyft Pink membership</li>
<li>Doordash Membership/ $60 credit as well</li>
<li>Accidental Insurance (I claimed a Gopro Hero 7 Black $400 which I lost sliding down a waterfall)</li>
<li>Baggage Insurance, if your baggage is lost or delayed</li>
<li>Trip Delay</li>
</ul>
This card gets even better if you have Chase Freedom Unlimited and Chase Ink Preferred. This trio is a killer combination which makes life easy and great. I am going to make a new video about it telling you in detail about it and how to get them. 
<br /> <br />

Will too many cards hurt my credit score?
<br /> 
This is absolute bullshit, the more cards you have the better your credit score and the less chances it will go down if you ever screw up something.
