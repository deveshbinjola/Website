        My first solo trip to Iceland was nothing less than total roller coaster. From loosing my bag to falling in a glacial lake to getting stuck alone in a black sand beach, there was nothing more excitement I could have asked for.

        So I have been making these travel videos for some time now but I have been travelling for a very long time and I know filming and editing these amazing pieces of art is incredibly fun but my main motive to start this channel/blog was to help my friends and other people around the world. I have consumed hours and hours of travel filmmaking content but one thing I figured out is that there is a shortage of content where creators are not talking about good ways for cheaper travel and the biggest reason is that influencers get sponsorship for their travel expenses and to be honest we can not all be influencers. So here's my guide for travelling cheaper, better, smarter. 

First things first, I will narrow down the things which are really important while travelling and it consists of 5 major things and I will add up secret 6th tip in the end:
Airfare
Hotels / Accommodation
Car rentals/Public transportation
Food
Gas and miscellaneous expenses

Let's start with Airfare, so this is one of the expensive things in every traveller's life. Fares can be really expensive sometimes and it's a major share of people’s travel expenses. So how can you avoid it or make it cheaper? There are a few ways:

Using Miles and Points: Most of my major international flights are booked using miles and I save tons of money by using this trick. In the last few years I have been collecting miles and points from different airlines and I use them to make travels cheaper. For example, for my last trip across Europe and India which had 7 flights in total I paid around 200$ and used 100000 miles. The regular ticket prices for the same itenary was around 3000$. So basically those 100000 miles were worth $2800 and I earned those 100000 miles basically for free? So how can you earn these miles and points, let’s sidebar that and talk about it later.

Try to cover a lot of flights together like a multi city and use stopovers and open jaws: So if you fly from North America to Asia via Europe, you can actually take breaks in between. 

Mistake fares: Mistakes Fares happen more often than not. You just have to be lucky to know about it at the right time. Last year a President Suite in Grand Hyatt, Santiago, Chile worth more than $1000 a night was available for $5 per night just because of a mistake fare. 

Flying budget airline: Every country has some major carriers and some budget airlines like the US has Spirit, Frontier, etc. India has Indigo and others, Europe has EVO or something but most countries have budget airlines which offer way cheaper tickets but they charge you almost everything during the flight like checked bags, food, drinks, etc. But if you do things right, pack light, book earlier you can be saving lots and lots of money by doing this.


Moving to Accomodation, which is the second thing people spend money on. To be honest, I spend the least amount of money on accommodations. So how do I do it? 

I try to camp in most places which is way cheaper, if I don’t have a tent I will try to sleep in my car.  I have slept in my car in so many different countries. I know a lot of people will be shy of doing it but another option is renting an RV/ Camper van which saves you a lot of money as well.

So you might think, how do I camp in bigger cities? I book hotels or hostels which are way cheaper. If you are alone you can get by living in a cheap hostel but if you are with your partner/spouse you might want to book a fancy hotel. I definitely agree to that and I do it all the time. When I was in Paris a few months ago I stayed in pretty good hotels for free. How? Credit cards, so there are many credit cards that offer 1 free night every year as a part of their membership. I booked a hotel which was 250$ and the annual fee I paid was $49. You understand what I am trying to say here. There are so many hotel chains offering free nights and points, make use of them.

Mistake fares do apply on this too but it's rare and you need to be super aware.


Coming to car rentals, there are many ways you can make car rentals cheaper

First being, renting from a common carrier like Hertz, enterprise, sixt or someone else. Also enroll in their rewards program like I am enrolled in Hertz Gold and current I am a President Circle member so I get free upgrades to 2 levels, like if I rent regular Sedan like Camry or Sonata, I can pick up an AWD SUV for no extra charge also I save a lot of time during checkouts.

Never buy insurance from car rental companies, use your credit card insurance. I use Chase Sapphire Reserve which offers pretty extensive insurance. I had a minor scratch on my car in the Europe trip on my tire and they charged me 1150 Euros for it but Chase covered it all.

Folks under 25: Use USAA membership if you are in USA which will waive your Young Driver fees which are around $11 - $15 per day depending on the car rental company you choose. I have been renting cars since I was 19 and I haven’t paid a single penny for this useless fee.

Also folks in the US, you can use Costco for renting cars, they have good deals and offer free additional drivers.

Food: You can spend or save a lot of money on food but it solely depends on you. I would like to tell you what I do when I am travelling. I basically eat out once every day and my one meal outside will be in a place/cuisine which is that place known for in a more traditional restaurant depending on where I am. First thing I do is go to a grocery store and buy a lot of stuff depending on the days I am there. Like I will buy a lot of fruits and other healthy snacks or sandwiches or salads which I can basically eat while driving and will save me a lot of money. I also buy Oatmeal/porridges for breakfasts. If I am staying at a hotel I will take advantage of their free breakfast which most hotels provide. 

Miscellaneous:

There are a few things you really can’t save on like gas/petrol, tolls, fees for cable cars or gondolas, entrance fees. You can still save up on entrance fees like if you like travelling to national parks, you can buy a national park pass which is $80/year for 2 different people with unlimited entrees, compare that to $35/park for 1 car. I travelled to 14 national parks last year and it only cost me $80. Compare that to $35 per park which costs $490. So I saved around $410 for it. 


Secret Tip: Travel Smartly. If you are a regular traveller using a good premium travel credit card is a must. I use several of these and my favorite is Chase Sapphire Reserve. All these premium credit cards seem to be expensive at first but if you do the math, they save you way more than you can expect of it barring you travel. I pay $550 per year for my CSR but they give me $300 back every year, a priority pass, $120 Doordash credit, Lyft high end membership, total coverage on rental cars anywhere in the world, accidental protection on stuff, baggage insurance, flight insurance, no foriegn transaction fees and so much more that most people don’t think about. I am not trying to sell you this card but if you ask my honest opinion I will ask you to get this card if you travel often or want to travel more. Also there’s a sign up bonus.
