        My first solo trip to Iceland was nothing less than total roller coaster. From loosing my bag to falling in a glacial lake to getting stuck alone in a black sand beach, there was nothing more excitement I could have asked for.

        So after exploring Iceland I headed to my second destination. Switzerland is an amazing country with beautiful mountains, blue clearwater lakes, delicious food and amazing people but what really stands out for me about Switzerland is it's neutrality. Switzerland has been a neutral country forever even during WW2 when Hitler almost captured all of Europe but couldn’t do anything to Switzerland. We as humans have been divided in every step of the way, be it religion, politics, decisions, everything but overcoming all these challenges and finding a middle ground is what brings happiness and that is why Switzerland has been one of the most happiest countries in the world. And I was excited to explore this amazing country and meet some amazing people.

<br /><br />The problem was that I had only 3 days to explore as a storm was approaching Switzerland but I wanted to utilize every minute of it and explore some of the most beautiful yet less crowded places. I really had no significant plan, I wanted to visit three places which were kind of far away from each other. I didn't book any hotels or anything, I just wanted to go with the flow and see where it lands me. I flew into Frankfurt, Germany on Oct 15, 2019, picked up my rental car from Sixt around 9:30 pm and headed down to Switzerland starting my 6 hour journey to Appenzell Irhoden in East Switzerland. I reached around 10 in the morning after sleeping for a few hours at a gas station. 

<br /><br />The drive itself was really amazing, East Switzerland is filled up with small villages and they make really beautiful landscapes. From there I took a cable car or gondola from Ebenalp station which was 32$or Swiss Franc upto the mountain. There are many options to hike from here, I chose to hike up to Schfaller mountain which was 3 km and the hike was amazing. After reaching the top I took a lot of pictures and flew my drone around to get some crazy shots of the place. From this place I could see three different countries, Austria, Germany and Switzerland. 

<br /><br />The craziest thing about Switzerland is that they have restaurants and lodges in some unique locations and this one of these. I always try to have some food which is really famous from that place, here I had Rosti which was made of potatoes and topped with eggs and bacon and had some local Appenzell beer. The lunch was delicious and my view was spectacular making it one of my best meals of life. After enjoying my meal I headed back to the cable car and then back to my car. I drove towards Zurich where I wanted to buy a tripod for my camera as my bag was lost by the airline.

<br /><br />I met an old Swiss couple on the top who told me about Rhine falls and some other great places in Switzerland and also suggested I visit back in May when the flowers in the valley turn pink and blue which makes this place out of the world. The only downside of East Switzerland was that there was no internet access here. I was using my Sprint (US) number, which worked everywhere else except in East Switzerland. After Zurich and around the area I headed down to my next bucket list destination, Lauterbrunnen. I stopped in a lot of places in between which I always do and this is one of the great benefits of a road trip.

<br /><br />I reached Lauterbrunnen around 8:30 PM which is kinda late for a village in a remote valley and finally now I got some internet access which was surprising because I didn't get any internet access in Zurich as well. Most of the hostels were closed but luckily I was able to find a room in Valley Hostel for $49, they were open just because one of the customers had not checked in yet. I got super lucky with this place as they had an empty room and they gave it to me for a really low price. I slept pretty nicely, charged up all my batteries and next morning I was ready for the most beautiful place in Switzerland and boy I was not let down. 

<br /><br />This place is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to. The waterfalls falling down in the valley made this valley feel so beautiful. I had to hike to Wengen, another closeby village where you can either hike or take a train for around $10, I chose to hike and that was one of the best decisions, the hike up and down Wengen was truly breathtaking. The views were really amazing and there were not many people on the hike so it was very nice and quiet. Wengen was quite amazing. I had lunch, I also bought some Swiss chocolates, enjoyed the beautiful views of the valley and flew my drone around. After spending some time in Wengen I came back down to explore Lauterbrunnen. 

<br /><br />I drove and walked around the valley, hiked up to the most beautiful waterfall there. After exploring Lauterbrunnen, I went to drive to Grindelwald, another beautiful Swiss town 20 mins away. The weather at this time started to change a little bit but the drive from Lauterbrunnen was absolutely amazing. I walked around Grindelwald, had a coffee and drove up to mountains for quite a while. I won’t lie but driving here was quite fun and for someone who really loves mountains, Jungfrau valley is like heaven. 

<br /><br />After Grindelwald I headed towards my third destination, Oeshchinese Lake which was around 1 and half hour away from Grindelwald. Kandersteg is the closest town to Oeshchinese Lake. I found a campsite called Rez-ondorous Kandersteg, which is one of the most beautiful places to camp. There were beautiful mountains around the campsite, the town was nearby and the cable car station was right there so I didn't have to pay for parking the next day which saved me some money. The price for a 1 night stay with Wifi was around 20$ and also they offered fresh bread to order for the morning. They had showers, laundry and basically everything that I needed, also there was a restaurant and a lodge right next to the campsite. I had a cheeseburger and truly it was really amazing, one of the best burgers I ever had. The chef told me that they get fresh meat everyday, and it was way better from the burgers in In-n Out, Shake Shack and Whataburger. 

<br /><br />After having my amazing meal I slept and next morning I woke up around sunrise which basically was super cool as the sun light started to hit the top of the mountains. After cleaning myself up I took the cable car up to the mountain. The cost of the ticket was 22 Swiss Francs/US Dollars. There was a 45 min hike down to the lake from the cable car station. I reached the lake and I can swear on this I have never seen more blue water than this lake and with such a huge backdrop. I hiked around the lake, took a lot of pictures and flew my drone around. There was a hotel and restaurant next to the lake. My excitement was cut short as the storm was coming closer and closer and it started raining. So I headed back to my car and then headed to my next destination which was Paris. I definitely wanted to explore more of Switzerland but sometimes things are not in your control and I have learnt to respect that and know that there will always be a next time. So till next time.

<br /><br />My trip was way cheaper than what most people spend in Switzerland. Hotels are generally a little expensive in Switzerland but I paid $70 in accommodations as I stayed in cheap places and basically slept in my car in a gas station one night. I have done this a few times so I feel comfortable doing it but I really don’t suggest anyone to do it who isn't comfortable. I spend around $54 on cable car tickets, you can skip these tickets if you want to hike up but I had less time so I chose to spend money on the ticket and then hike after that. I rented an Audi A4 for 8 days for less than $300 from Sixt and the car was great. 

<br /><br />Food was particularly expensive in Switzerland, each meal with a drink cost around $20 - 25 which is not that bad and the food was really good. I try to eat out only once every day when I am travelling and that too something local, other than I buy some fruits and other food items from grocery stores which saves me a lot of money. It works for me. Gas/Petrol is expensive in Expensive, even more expensive than Iceland in some areas. I saw around 1.5-1.7 $ per litre which is almost 3 times the average price of gas in Austin, Texas. If you don’t want to drive, I will suggest buying a Swiss train pass which is a bit expensive but it's worth it. I am definitely buying that Swiss pass when I visit Switzerland next time and hopefully I have more time to spend in this beautiful country. People are really amazing in Switzerland, locals are very friendly and nice. The only other thing to take care about are speeding cameras around the country. In total I spent around $300 for 3 days in Switzerland including all expenses which is a steal.
