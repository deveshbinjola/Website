        My first solo trip to Iceland was nothing less than total roller coaster. From loosing my bag to falling in a glacial lake to getting stuck alone in a black sand beach, there wasn't more excitement I could have asked for. Among all this I had so much fun exploring the wilderness in Iceland. It is one of those places that keeps calling you back.

        I have always wanted to visit Iceland and finally that wish came true last October when I started my solo trip. So I had 5 days and I wanted to do a complete roadtrip of the ring road which covers most of the country. So I landed in Iceland with all my excitement for the 5 most amazing days of my life coming to reality that Lufthansa lost one of my checked bags which had most of my clothes and some camera equipment. After filing missing reports and other stuff I picked up my RV rental from LAVA and headed to the capital city of Reykjavik. There’s a Costco in Reykjavik and the prices there are pretty awesome compared to some other stores. I bought fruits, some pre packaged cooked meals and some clothes for the next 5 days. I also had to shop for some camera equipment like Tripod which was in my other bag. So after shopping I headed to my first destination of Seljalandsfoss.

        <br /><br />I reached there around 8 pm and it was already dark by then but you can still see the waterfall which looked amazing. There’s a campground right next to the waterfall so I camped there hoping I could see the northern lights on the very first night in Iceland but my excitement was cut short as it rained pretty much all night and it was really cold inside the campervan. The cost to camp was around $15. Next morning I woke up in one of the most beautiful places on earth. I explored the waterfall, there’s also another waterfall right next to Seljalandsfoss waterfall which is kind of inside a cave and looks crazy. After exploring the waterfalls I headed to the next destination Skogafoss waterfall. You might have heard, seen this waterfall a million times in pictures but the feeling of seeing it in person is absolutely incredible and none compared to anything else. There were way too many people here as it was around 9 am and it was a very beautiful day in Iceland.

        <br /><br />After that I headed down to DC3 plane wreck but I saw an amazing beautiful looking road leading upto a glacier and I turned that way. I reached this glacier and started hiking up. First 1 mile was a hike around a lake that leads to a glacier. When I reached the starting point of the glacier I accidentally kept my foot on black ice and I slipped into the lake. At first I was calm and I was moving my feet but as soon I felt the cold glacier water I had rushed out and all my clothes were drenched in water. I had to rush back to my RV and now I had no more dry clothes left so I had to rush to a clothing store which was 2 hour drive away. I wrapped myself in a towel and drove to the store to buy some clothes. Finally buying a couple of trousers which were really expensive I headed back to some of the other places that I missed like Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach, Dyrhólaey. I couldn’t go to the DC3 plane wreck as it needed a 45 mins hike and it started raining pretty hard when I reached there. Iceland is one of the places in this world which is full of amazing scenery all around the country and you really don’t need to go to a lot of landmarks. I explored a lot of places around and ended up my day at Vatnajökull National Park. The cost to camp was around $15.

        <br /><br />Next morning, I explored the area a little bit but I was excited about visiting Jökulsárlón which is basically floating ice on a lake. There’s a massive glacier behind and the ice melts and comes down to the lake/lagoon and then the Diamond beach. I did not visit Diamond beach, I really don’t know why but there’s always a next time. After that I headed to Vestrahorn, the most beautiful black mountains in East Iceland.

        <br /><br />After exploring Vestrahorn I headed to Hengifoss which was around 3 hours away. The drive was amazing but the roads started to wear down here and also my RV got stuck on a black sand beach as I wanted to take some drone shots of the beach. It took me 45 mins and help of 4 other amazing people to get me out of it. Just to tell people who are a little scared of travelling alone, the people I have met on the road are some of the most amazing people I have ever met. Sweet, helpful, great conversations. This is just my experience though, other people might have different experiences but mine has been amazing. After my RV got out I was back on the road to Hengifoss now not trying to stop everywhere and not to do anything crazy as everything has been going down.

                Hengifoss Waterfall</small></center>
        <br /><br />I reached Hengifoss around 4:00 pm and sunsets around 6:00 pm so I had around 2 hours to explore the area. The weather wasn’t looking really great, it was really cloudy. The hike to the waterfall was around 30-40 mins. It was an easy hike and I was very happy that I chose to hike this waterfall. I flew my drone around, took a lot of pictures and enjoyed the view for a while after heading back. I camped at Camp Egilsstadir which was 30 mins from there. It did not cost me anything to camp here as it was the weekend and the office was closed. It was one of the best campsites I stayed in Iceland. There were hot pools nearby, a lot of restaurants, stores (which were closed because of the weekend). There were hot showers, a kitchen to warm up your food and a lot of stuff. Basically I felt bad staying there for free. Overnight it started to snow, it wasn’t quite heavy where I was but it was heavier in Northern Iceland where I was headed next. I couldn’t see the northern lights yet.

                  Viti Crater</small></center>
        <br /><br />My next destination was Studagil Canyon which is one of the most beautiful places in Iceland but because of the snow, the hike was a little hard and waterflow in the canyon was way higher so I couldn't go down. After that I headed to Northern Iceland to see some craters and volcanic activities. I started with Hverir which are geothermal pools of mud and other stuff. After that I headed Viti Crater, It was really beautiful and it snowed the night before so the landscape looked really amazing
