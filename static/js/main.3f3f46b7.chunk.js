The views were really amazing and there were not many people on the hike so it was very nice and quiet. Wengen was quite amazing. I had lunch, I also bought some Swiss chocolates, enjoyed the beautiful views of the valley and flew my drone around. After spending some time in Wengen I came back down to explore Lauterbrunnen.

The weather at this time started to change a little bit but the drive from Lauterbrunnen was absolutely amazing. I walked around Grindelwald, had a coffee and drove up to mountains for quite a while.

They had showers, laundry and basically everything that I needed, also there was a restaurant and a lodge right next to the campsite.

I spend around $54 on cable car tickets, you can skip these tickets if you want to hike up but I had less time so I chose to spend money on the ticket and then hike after that.

I saw around 1.5-1.7 $ per litre which is almost 3 times the average price of gas in Austin, Texas. If you don\u2019t want to drive, I will suggest buying a Swiss train pass which is a bit expensive but it's worth it. I am definitely buying that Swiss pass when I visit Switzerland next time and hopefully I have more time to spend in this beautiful country.

First thing I do is go to a grocery store and buy a lot of stuff depending on the days I am there. Like I will buy a lot of fruits and other healthy snacks or sandwiches or salads which I can basically eat while driving and will save me a lot of money. I also buy Oatmeal/porridges for breakfasts. If I am staying at a hotel I will take advantage of their free breakfast which most hotels provide.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("span",{id:"textSpan",style:{fontWeight:"bold"}},"Miscellaneous:")," There are a few things you really can\u2019t save on like gas/petrol, tolls, fees for cable cars or gondolas, entrance fees. You can still save up on entrance fees like if you like travelling to national parks, you can buy a national park pass which is $80/year for 2 different people with unlimited entrees, compare that to $35/park for 1 car. I travelled to 14 national parks last year and it only cost me $80. Compare that to $35 per park which costs $490. So I saved around $410 for it.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("span",{id:"textSpan",style:{fontWeight:"bold"}},"Secret Tip:")," Travel Smartly. If you are a regular traveller using a good premium travel credit card is a must. I use several of these and my favorite is Chase Sapphire Reserve. All these premium credit cards seem to be expensive at first but if you do the math, they save you way more than you can expect of it barring you travel. I pay $550 per year for my CSR but they give me $300 back every year, a priority pass, $120 Doordash credit, Lyft high end membership, total coverage on rental cars anywhere in the world, accidental protection on stuff, baggage insurance, flight insurance, no foriegn transaction fees and so much more that most people don\u2019t think about. I am not trying to sell you this card but if you ask my honest opinion I will ask you to get this card if you travel often or want to travel more. Also there\u2019s a sign up bonus. \xcd"),l.a.createElement(v.a,null,l.a.createElement(I.a,{sm:"6",lg:"4"},l.a.createElement("a",{href:"/firstcard",target:"_blank"},l.a.createElement("img",{alt:"...",className:"img-rounded img-no-padding img-responsive",src:t(41),height:"350px",width:"350px"}),l.a.createElement("h4",{className:"text-center"},"Applying for your First Card"))),l.a.createElement(I.a,{sm:"6",lg:"4"},l.a.createElement("a",{href:"/top10cards",target:"_blank"},l.a.createElement("img",{alt:"...",className:"img-rounded img-no-padding img-responsive",src:t(13),height:"350px",width:"350px"}),l.a.createElement("h4",{className:"text-center"},"Top 10 Credit Cards"))),l.a.createElement(I.a,{sm:"6",lg:"4"},l.a.createElement("a",{href:"/battleofthebest",target:"_blank"},l.a.createElement("img",{alt:"...",className:"img-rounded img-no-padding img-responsive",src:t(42),height:"350px",width:"350px"}),l.a.createElement("h4",{className:"text-center"},"Best Travel Cards"))))),l.a.createElement(k,null))};pe.a.initialize("UA-82402078-1"),pe.a.pageview(window.location.pathname+window.location.search),o.a.render(l.a.createElement(i.a,null,l.a.createElement(s.d,null,l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(P,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/about",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(U,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/blog",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(K,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/creditadvice",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(ee,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/digitalnomad",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(ne,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/travelblog",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(le,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/traveltips",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(re,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/hiking",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(se,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/iceland",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(ce,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/switzerland",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(ue,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/paris",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(he,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/firstcard",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(ge,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/top10cards",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(ye,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/battleofthebest",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(fe,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.b,{path:"/travelsmarter",render:function(e){return l.a.createElement(we,e)}}),l.a.createElement(s.a,{to:"/"}))),document.getElementById("root"))}],[[51,1,2]]]);
