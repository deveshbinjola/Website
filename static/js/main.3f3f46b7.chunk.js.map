didn't have money to travel. Fast forward 4 years now I have learnt a few things about it, have been travelling using the things I learnt and now I am on my journey to explore the world. I am a Digital Nomad, I stay in a place for 4 to 6 weeks and explore around the area. I love hiking and often do bagpacking trips, it helps me get closer to nature.

There are 3 ways to pay:\n          <ul>\n            <li>Cash (Venmo, Check, Bitcoin, Online transfer)</li>\n            <li>Debit Card</li>\n            <li>Credit Card</li>\n          </ul>\n          Using Cash and Debit cards is basically useless. Only Credit cards reward you to spend money. <span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>A credit card lets you purchase things upto a certain limit each month and then gives you 25 days to pay it back for free from the statement end date, after that charges an interest rate.</span> You can use these rewards for many different things. There are four different types of rewards:\n          <ul>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Cashback rewards.</span></li>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Airline / Hotel rewards.</span></li>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Credit card rewards.</span> Transferrable  to different hotels and airlines. Amex MR, Chase UR</li>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Store rewards.</span></li>\n          </ul>\n          \n          A lot of people really don't understand power and value of credit cards. That is why I made this simple post to help. <span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>I have earned over 1.5 million points or miles using credit cards over last 5 years.</span> I have used these rewards to fly for free to different countries and booked a lot of free hotels. I want to help people utilize the full potential of credit cards and see how useful they can be if used properly. \n          \n          <br /><br />\n          I use credit cards for every purchase except when cash is the only option. Benefits of credit cards are not just limited to rewards points but before telling you that I want to tell you the basic rule of using credit cards:<span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}> Never spend on anything that you can’t afford and always pay your balance in full every month (best is to set it up on Autopay).</span>  You can choose which kind of rewards are best suited for you by choosing the right cards. Credit cards can be broken down into <span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>No Annual fee </span>and <span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Annual fee</span> cards. Annual fees ranges from $49 upto $550. Annual fee is charged for the services provided by the credit card company. \n          <h3>\n            How to earn points using credit cards?\n          </h3>\n          <ul>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Spending</span> You earn minimum of 1 point per dollar spent. Cards offer bonus points depending on categories, like a travel card might offer 2 bonus points/$ on travel/restaurants where as a business card might offer on utility payments.</li>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Bonus Points</span>. Cards offer bonus points (upto 200,000 points) when you sign up for the card. Chase Sapphire Reserve gave me 100,000 bonus points when I first signed up, current bonus is 50,000 points.</li>\n          </ul>\n          So every dollar you spend, you get points for that depending on what credit card you use. Like a travel card will give bonus points on travel and dining expenses. A business card will give bonus points for business expenses and a grocery card will give bonus points in supermarkets. You can use these points to do a lot of stuff. <span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>But getting credit cards is not easy. </span>It really depends on your credit history (a 350-850 score which determines your credit power). \n          \n          <h3>\n          What do I spend my points on?\n          </h3>\n          I spend my points mostly on travel like booking airplane tickets and hotels. I never use cashback cards, I feel the most value of credit card rewards come through spending on airline tickets.\n          <h3>\n          Will too many cards hurt my credit score?\n          </h3>\n          This is absolute wrong, the more cards you have the better your credit score and the less chances it will go down if you ever screw up something. \n          \n          <h3>Top 5 Credit cards (My go to cards) </h3>\n          <ol>\n            <li>Chase Sapphire Reserve</li>\n            <li>Chase Sapphire Preferred</li>\n            <li>Chase Freedom Unlimited</li>\n            <li>Amex EveryDay Rewards Card</li>\n            <li>Citi Prestige Card</li>\n          </ol>\n          Here is a breakdown of the benfits provided apart from points by one my favorite travel cards of all time <span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Chase Sapphire Reserve</span> which charges $550 per year.\n          <br /><br />\n          <ul>\n            <li>$300 travel credit every year.</li>\n            <li>Priority Pass Lounge membership (over 1400 lounges - $200 value)</li>\n            <li>Reimbursement for your TSA Precheck / Global Entry (for foreigners living in USA) which is $100 for 5 years</li>\n            <li>Primary Car Rental insurance (I have used it in Europe, 100% cost covered, they paid $1200)</li>\n            <li>Lyft Pink and Doordash Membership ($60 credit as well)</li>\n            <li>Accidental Insurance (I claimed a Gopro Hero 7 Black $400 which I lost sliding down a waterfall)</li>\n            <li>Baggage Insurance and Trip Delay Insurance</li>\n          </ul>\n          I have been using this card since 2016 (when it first launched) and has been my primary card.

As COVID-19 hit the world most companies started to encourage their emolyees to work remote and the company I work for went completely remote as well giving me an opportunity to get closer to my dream life.

than total roller coaster. From loosing my bag to falling in a glacial lake to getting stuck alone in a black sand beach, there wasn't more excitement I could have asked for. Among all this I had so much fun exploring the wilderness in Iceland. It is one of those places that keeps calling you back.  \n        <br /><br />\n        <Button color=\"success\" target= '_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqGP6tWxaTs&t=8s' >Watch Travel Video</Button>\n        \n        </h6>\n        </Container>\n        </Jumbotron>\n      \n        <Container>\n        <p className=\"lead\" style={{ color: 'black' }}>\n        \n        I have always wanted to visit Iceland and finally that wish came true last October when I started my solo trip. So I had 5 days and I wanted to do a complete roadtrip of the ring road which covers most of the country. So I landed in Iceland with all my excitement for the 5 most amazing days of my life coming to reality that Lufthansa lost one of my checked bags which had most of my clothes and some camera equipment. After filing missing reports and other stuff I picked up my RV rental from LAVA and headed to the capital city of Reykjavik. There’s a Costco in Reykjavik and the prices there are pretty awesome compared to some other stores. I bought fruits, some pre packaged cooked meals and some clothes for the next 5 days. I also had to shop for some camera equipment like Tripod which was in my other bag. So after shopping I headed to my first destination of Seljalandsfoss. \n        <center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Iceland/3.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Selalajafoss Waterfall</small></center>\n        <br />I reached there around 8 pm and it was already dark by then but you can still see the waterfall which looked amazing. There’s a campground right next to the waterfall so I camped there hoping I could see the northern lights on the very first night in Iceland but my excitement was cut short as it rained pretty much all night and it was really cold inside the campervan. The cost to camp was around $15. Next morning I woke up in one of the most beautiful places on earth. I explored the waterfall, there’s also another waterfall right next to Seljalandsfoss waterfall which is kind of inside a cave and looks crazy. After exploring the waterfalls I headed to the next destination Skogafoss waterfall. You might have heard, seen this waterfall a million times in pictures but the feeling of seeing it in person is absolutely incredible and none compared to anything else. There were way too many people here as it was around 9 am and it was a very beautiful day in Iceland. \n        <center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Iceland/2.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Skogafoss Waterfall</small></center>\n        <br />After that I headed down to DC3 plane wreck but I saw an amazing beautiful looking road leading upto a glacier and I turned that way. I reached this glacier and started hiking up. First 1 mile was a hike around a lake that leads to a glacier. When I reached the starting point of the glacier I accidentally kept my foot on black ice and I slipped into the lake. At first I was calm and I was moving my feet but as soon I felt the cold glacier water I had rushed out and all my clothes were drenched in water. I had to rush back to my RV and now I had no more dry clothes left so I had to rush to a clothing store which was 2 hour drive away. I wrapped myself in a towel and drove to the store to buy some clothes. Finally buying a couple of trousers which were really expensive I headed back to some of the other places that I missed like Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach, Dyrhólaey. I couldn’t go to the DC3 plane wreck as it needed a 45 mins hike and it started raining pretty hard when I reached there. Iceland is one of the places in this world which is full of amazing scenery all around the country and you really don’t need to go to a lot of landmarks. I explored a lot of places around and ended up my day at Vatnajökull National Park. The cost to camp was around $15.\n        <center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Iceland/skogafoss.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Skogafoss Waterfall</small></center>\n        <br />Next morning, I explored the area a little bit but I was excited about visiting Jökulsárlón which is basically floating ice on a lake. There’s a massive glacier behind and the ice melts and comes down to the lake/lagoon and then the Diamond beach. I did not visit Diamond beach, I really don’t know why but there’s always a next time. After that I headed to Vestrahorn, the most beautiful black mountains in East Iceland. \n        <center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Iceland/food.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Skogafoss Waterfall</small></center>\n        <br />After exploring Vestrahorn I headed to Hengifoss which was around 3 hours away. The drive was amazing but the roads started to wear down here and also my RV got stuck on a black sand beach as I wanted to take some drone shots of the beach. It took me 45 mins and help of 4 other amazing people to get me out of it. Just to tell people who are a little scared of travelling alone, the people I have met on the road are some of the most amazing people I have ever met. Sweet, helpful, great conversations. This is just my experience though, other people might have different experiences but mine has been amazing. After my RV got out I was back on the road to Hengifoss now not trying to stop everywhere and not to do anything crazy as everything has been going down.\n        <center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Iceland/DJI_0111.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                Hengifoss Waterfall</small></center>\n        <br />I reached Hengifoss around 4:00 pm and sunsets around 6:00 pm so I had around 2 hours to explore the area. The weather wasn’t looking really great, it was really cloudy. The hike to the waterfall was around 30-40 mins. It was an easy hike and I was very happy that I chose to hike this waterfall. I flew my drone around, took a lot of pictures and enjoyed the view for a while after heading back. I camped at Camp Egilsstadir which was 30 mins from there. It did not cost me anything to camp here as it was the weekend and the office was closed. It was one of the best campsites I stayed in Iceland. There were hot pools nearby, a lot of restaurants, stores (which were closed because of the weekend). There were hot showers, a kitchen to warm up your food and a lot of stuff. Basically I felt bad staying there for free. Overnight it started to snow, it wasn’t quite heavy where I was but it was heavier in Northern Iceland where I was headed next. I couldn’t see the northern lights yet. \n        <center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Iceland/crater.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Viti Crater</small></center>\n        <br />My next destination was Studagil Canyon which is one of the most beautiful places in Iceland but because of the snow, the hike was a little hard and waterflow in the canyon was way higher so I couldn't go down. After that I headed to Northern Iceland to see some craters and volcanic activities. I started with Hverir which are geothermal pools of mud and other stuff. After that I headed Viti Crater, It was really beautiful and it snowed the night before so the landscape looked really amazing\n        <center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Iceland/crater.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Skogafoss Waterfall</small></center>\n        </p>\n        </Container>\n        <DemoFooter />\n        </>\n      );\n    }\n    \nexport default Iceland;\n\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport DemoFooter from \"components/Footers/DemoFooter.js\";\nimport NavBar from \"../sections/Navbar.js\";\nimport { Container, Jumbotron, Button } from \"reactstrap\";\nimport imgUrl from \"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/3.jpg\";\nimport \"./styles.css\";\n\nfunction Switzerland() {\n    return (\n        <>\n       <NavBar />\n       <Jumbotron className=\"jumbotron\" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${imgUrl})`}}>\n       <div className=\"overlay\"></div>\n\n         <Container>\n        <h6 className=\"display-3\" style={{ color: 'white' }}><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>3 Bucketlist Places in Switzerland</span></h6>\n        <h6 className=\"subheading\" style={{ color: 'white' }}><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>\n        Switzerland is one of the most beautiful countries in the world.

It is an amazing country but what really stands out for me about Switzerland is it's neutrality. Switzerland has been a neutral country forever even during WW2 when Hitler almost captured all of Europe but couldn’t do anything to Switzerland. We as humans have been divided in every step of the way, be it religion, politics, decisions, everything but overcoming all these challenges and finding a middle ground is what brings happiness and that is why Switzerland has been one of the most happiest countries in the world. And I was excited to explore this amazing country and meet some amazing people.\n        <center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/1.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Appenzell Valley</small></center>\n<br />The problem was that I had only 3 days to explore as a storm was approaching Switzerland but I wanted to utilize every minute of it and explore some of the most beautiful yet less crowded places. I really had no significant plan, I wanted to visit three places which were kind of far away from each other. I didn't book any hotels or anything, I just wanted to go with the flow and see where it lands me. I flew into Frankfurt, Germany on Oct 15, 2019, picked up my rental car from Sixt around 9:30 pm and headed down to Switzerland starting my 6 hour journey to Appenzell Irhoden in East Switzerland. I reached around 10 in the morning after sleeping for a few hours at a gas station. \n<center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/6.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Appenzell Valley</small></center>\n<br />The drive itself was really amazing, East Switzerland is filled up with small villages and they make really beautiful landscapes. From there I took a cable car or gondola from Ebenalp station which was 32$or Swiss Franc upto the mountain. There are many options to hike from here, I chose to hike up to Schfaller mountain which was 3 km and the hike was amazing. After reaching the top I took a lot of pictures and flew my drone around to get some crazy shots of the place. From this place I could see three different countries, Austria, Germany and Switzerland. \n<center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/3.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Lauterbrunnen</small></center>\n<br />The craziest thing about Switzerland is that they have restaurants and lodges in some unique locations and this one of these. I always try to have some food which is really famous from that place, here I had Rosti which was made of potatoes and topped with eggs and bacon and had some local Appenzell beer. The lunch was delicious and my view was spectacular making it one of my best meals of life. After enjoying my meal I headed back to the cable car and then back to my car. I drove towards Zurich where I wanted to buy a tripod for my camera as my bag was lost by the airline.\n<center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/4.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Wengen, Jungfrau Region</small></center>\n<br />I met an old Swiss couple on the top who told me about Rhine falls and some other great places in Switzerland and also suggested I visit back in May when the flowers in the valley turn pink and blue which makes this place out of the world. The only downside of East Switzerland was that there was no internet access here. I was using my Sprint (US) number, which worked everywhere else except in East Switzerland. After Zurich and around the area I headed down to my next bucket list destination, Lauterbrunnen. I stopped in a lot of places in between which I always do and this is one of the great benefits of a road trip.\n<center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/9.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Lauterbrunnen Waterfalls </small></center>\n<br />I reached Lauterbrunnen around 8:30 PM which is kinda late for a village in a remote valley and finally now I got some internet access which was surprising because I didn't get any internet access in Zurich as well. Most of the hostels were closed but luckily I was able to find a room in Valley Hostel for $49, they were open just because one of the customers had not checked in yet. I got super lucky with this place as they had an empty room and they gave it to me for a really low price. I slept pretty nicely, charged up all my batteries and next morning I was ready for the most beautiful place in Switzerland and boy I was not let down. \n<center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/6.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Oischenese Lake</small></center>\n<br />This place is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to. The waterfalls falling down in the valley made this valley feel so beautiful. I had to hike to Wengen, another closeby village where you can either hike or take a train for around $10, I chose to hike and that was one of the best decisions, the hike up and down Wengen was truly breathtaking. The views were really amazing and there were not many people on the hike so it was very nice and quiet. Wengen was quite amazing. I had lunch, I also bought some Swiss chocolates, enjoyed the beautiful views of the valley and flew my drone around. After spending some time in Wengen I came back down to explore Lauterbrunnen. \nI drove and walked around the valley, hiked up to the most beautiful waterfall there. After exploring Lauterbrunnen, I went to drive to Grindelwald, another beautiful Swiss town 20 mins away. The weather at this time started to change a little bit but the drive from Lauterbrunnen was absolutely amazing. I walked around Grindelwald, had a coffee and drove up to mountains for quite a while. I won’t lie but driving here was quite fun and for someone who really loves mountains, Jungfrau valley is like heaven. \n<center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/1.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Appenzell Valley</small></center>\n<br />After Grindelwald I headed towards my third destination, Oeshchinese Lake which was around 1 and half hour away from Grindelwald. Kandersteg is the closest town to Oeshchinese Lake. I found a campsite called Rez-ondorous Kandersteg, which is one of the most beautiful places to camp. There were beautiful mountains around the campsite, the town was nearby and the cable car station was right there so I didn't have to pay for parking the next day which saved me some money. The price for a 1 night stay with Wifi was around 20$ and also they offered fresh bread to order for the morning. They had showers, laundry and basically everything that I needed, also there was a restaurant and a lodge right next to the campsite. I had a cheeseburger and truly it was really amazing, one of the best burgers I ever had. The chef told me that they get fresh meat everyday, and it was way better from the burgers in In-n Out, Shake Shack and Whataburger. \n<center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/6.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                Oischenese Lake</small></center>\n<br />After having my amazing meal I slept and next morning I woke up around sunrise which basically was super cool as the sun light started to hit the top of the mountains. After cleaning myself up I took the cable car up to the mountain. The cost of the ticket was 22 Swiss Francs/US Dollars. There was a 45 min hike down to the lake from the cable car station. I reached the lake and I can swear on this I have never seen more blue water than this lake and with such a huge backdrop. I hiked around the lake, took a lot of pictures and flew my drone around. There was a hotel and restaurant next to the lake. My excitement was cut short as the storm was coming closer and closer and it started raining. So I headed back to my car and then headed to my next destination which was Paris. I definitely wanted to explore more of Switzerland but sometimes things are not in your control and I have learnt to respect that and know that there will always be a next time. So till next time.\n<center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/swiss.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Oischenese Lake</small></center>\n<br />My trip was way cheaper than what most people spend in Switzerland. Hotels are generally a little expensive in Switzerland but I paid $70 in accommodations as I stayed in cheap places and basically slept in my car in a gas station one night. I have done this a few times so I feel comfortable doing it but I really don’t suggest anyone to do it who isn't comfortable. I spend around $54 on cable car tickets, you can skip these tickets if you want to hike up but I had less time so I chose to spend money on the ticket and then hike after that. I rented an Audi A4 for 8 days for less than $300 from Sixt and the car was great. \n<center><img\n                  alt=\"...\"\n                  className=\"img-rounded img-responsive \"\n                  height=\"400px\"\n                  \n                  src={require(\"assets/img/Photos/Switzerland/1.jpg\")}\n                />\n                <center></center><small>\n                  Appenzell Valley</small></center>\n<br />Food was particularly expensive in Switzerland, each meal with a drink cost around $20 - 25 which is not that bad and the food was really good. I try to eat out only once every day when I am travelling and that too something local, other than I buy some fruits and other food items from grocery stores which saves me a lot of money. It works for me. Gas/Petrol is expensive in Expensive, even more expensive than Iceland in some areas. I saw around 1.5-1.7 $ per litre which is almost 3 times the average price of gas in Austin, Texas. If you don’t want to drive, I will suggest buying a Swiss train pass which is a bit expensive but it's worth it. I am definitely buying that Swiss pass when I visit Switzerland next time and hopefully I have more time to spend in this beautiful country. People are really amazing in Switzerland, locals are very friendly and nice. The only other thing to take care about are speeding cameras around the country. In total I spent around $300 for 3 days in Switzerland including all expenses which is a steal.\n\n        </p>\n        </Container>\n        <DemoFooter />\n        </>\n      );\n    }\n    \nexport default Switzerland;\n\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport DemoFooter from \"components/Footers/DemoFooter.js\";\nimport NavBar from \"../sections/Navbar.js\";\nimport { Container } from \"reactstrap\";\n\nfunction Paris() {\n    return (\n        <>\n        <NavBar />\n        <Container>\n            \n        </Container>\n        <DemoFooter />\n        </>\n      );\n    }\n    \nexport default Paris;\n\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport DemoFooter from \"components/Footers/DemoFooter.js\";\nimport NavBar from \"./sections/Navbar.js\";\nimport { Container, Jumbotron } from \"reactstrap\";\nimport imgUrl from \"assets/img/credit.jpg\";\n\nfunction FirstCard() {\n    return (\n        <>\n        <NavBar />\n        <Jumbotron className=\"jumbotron\" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${imgUrl})`}}>\n       <div className=\"overlay\"></div>\n\n       <Container>\n         <br /> <br /><br /> <br />\n        <h6 className=\"display-3 text-center\" style={{ color: 'white' }}><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Applying for your First credit card</span></h6>\n        </Container>\n        </Jumbotron>\n        <Container>\n          <p className='lead'>\n          My First Credit Card was Bank of America Cash Rewards Card which I got on the day I got my SSN.

Though CSR has one more unique feature of linking with <b>Chase Freedom Unlimited</b>, which gives 1.5 points on all the purchases.<br>AMEX Platinum has a nice 5x of Airfare and Hotels but that should be purchased directly with airlines or from the AMEX travel portal which I believe is rubbish as there are very few people who book flights/hotels directly through their websites.

But I am afraid, people having Amex Platinum Card uses Uber that often unless they live in big city like San Francisco or New York.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n<thead class=\"thead\">\n    <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th><center>Chase Sapphire Reserve</center></th>\n    <th><center>AMEX Platinum Card</center></th>\n    <th><center>Citi Prestige</center></th>\n    </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Annual Travel Credit</th>\n    <td><center>$300 (on any travel purchase)</center></td>\n    <td><center><b>$200 (Uber) + $200 (Air Travel Credit)</b></center></td>\n    <td><center>$250 (Air Travel Credit)</center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">VIP Lounges Membership</th>\n    <td><center>Priority Pass Select</center></td>\n    <td><center>Global Lounge collection</center></td>\n    <td><center>Priority Pass Select</center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">No. of Lounges</th>\n    <td><center>900+</center></td>\n    <td><center><b>1000+</b></center></td>\n    <td><center>900+</center></td>\n    </tr>\n<tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Guest Free Access</th>\n    <td><center>All guests in your travel party</center></td>\n    <td><center><b>2</b></center></td>\n    <td><center>2</center></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Winner:</b> AMEX Platinum Card</p>\n<p><b>Runner Up:</b> Chase Sapphire Reserve</p>\n<br />\n<img src=\"Image/newplatinum.png\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n    <div class=\"lower\">\n        The new AMEX Platinum Card with metal design.\n    </div>\n<br />\n\n<h4><b>Travel Partners</b></h4>\n<p>By travel partners I mean, to which airlines or hotels you can transfer your points.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n<thead class=\"thead\">\n    <tr>\n    <th><center>Chase Sapphire Reserve</center></th>\n    <th><center>AMEX Platinum Card</center></th>\n    <th><center>Citi Prestige</center></th>\n    </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td><center>British Airways</center></td>\n    <td><center>British Airways</center></td>\n    <td><center>Eva Air</center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><center>Singapore Airlines</center></td>\n    <td><center>Singapore Airlines</center></td>\n    <td><center>Singapore Airlines</center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><center>Flying Blue</center></td>\n    <td><center>Flying Blue</center></td>\n    <td><center>Flying Blue</center></td>\n    </tr>\n<tr>\n    <td><center>Korean Air</center></td>\n    <td><center>Air Canada</center></td>\n    <td><center>Asia Miles</center></td>\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n    <td><center>Southwest</center></td>\n    <td><center>ANA</center></td>\n    <td><center>Virgin America</center></td>\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n    <td><center>United</center></td>\n    <td><center>Emirates</center></td>\n    <td><center>Malaysia Airlines</center></td>\n    </tr>\n<tr>\n    <td><center>Virgin Atlantic</center></td>\n    <td><center>Etihad</center></td>\n    <td><center>Etihad</center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><center>Hyatt</center></td>\n    <td><center>Air Mexico</center></td>\n    <td><center>Qatar Airways</center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><center>IHG</center></td>\n    <td><center>Virgin America</center></td>\n    <td><center>Garuda Indonesia</center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><center>Marriott</center></td>\n    <td><center>Jet Blue</center></td>\n    <td><center>Royal Orchid Plus</center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><center>Ritz Carlton</center></td>\n    <td><center>Hilton</center></td>\n    <td><center>Hilton</center></td>\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n    <td><center></center></td>\n    <td><center>SPG</center></td>\n    <td><center></center></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table> */}\n\n\n        </Container>\n        <DemoFooter />\n        </>\n      );\n    }\n    \nexport default BattleoftheBest;\n\n","\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport DemoFooter from \"components/Footers/DemoFooter.js\";\nimport NavBar from \"../sections/Navbar.js\";\nimport { Container, Jumbotron, Row, Col } from \"reactstrap\";\nimport imgUrl from \"assets/img/navigation.jpg\";\n\nfunction TravelSmarter() {\n    return (\n        <>\n        <NavBar />\n        <Jumbotron className=\"jumbotron\" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${imgUrl})`}}>\n       <div className=\"overlay\"></div>\n\n       <Container>\n         <br /> <br /><br /> <br />\n        <h6 className=\"display-3 text-center\" style={{ color: 'white' }}><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>How to Travel Smarter?</span></h6>\n        </Container>\n        </Jumbotron>\n        <Container>\n          <p className='lead text-justify'>\n\n          So I have been making these travel videos for some time now but I have been travelling for a very long time and I know filming and editing these amazing pieces of art is incredibly fun but my main motive to start this channel/blog was to help my friends and other people around the world. I have consumed hours and hours of travel filmmaking content but one thing I figured out is that there is a shortage of content where creators are not talking about good ways for cheaper travel and the biggest reason is that influencers get sponsorship for their travel expenses and to be honest we can not all be influencers. So here's my guide for travelling cheaper, better, smarter. \n          <br /><br />\n          First things first, I will narrow down the things which are really important while travelling and it consists of 5 major things and I will add up secret 6th tip in the end:\n          <ol>\n            <li>Airfare</li>\n            <li>Hotels / Accommodation</li>\n            <li>Car rentals/Public transportation</li>\n            <li>Food</li>\n            <li>Gas and miscellaneous expenses</li>\n          </ol>\n\n          Let's start with Airfare, so this is one of the expensive things in every traveller's life. Fares can be really expensive sometimes and it's a major share of people’s travel expenses. So how can you avoid it or make it cheaper? There are a few ways:          \n           <ol>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Using Miles and Points:</span> Most of my major international flights are booked using miles and I save tons of money by using this trick. In the last few years I have been collecting miles and points from different airlines and I use them to make travels cheaper. For example, for my last trip across Europe and India which had 7 flights in total I paid around 200$ and used 100000 miles. The regular ticket prices for the same itenary was around 3000$. So basically those 100000 miles were worth $2800 and I earned those 100000 miles basically for free? So how can you earn these miles and points, let’s sidebar that and talk about it later.</li>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Try to cover a lot of flights together like a multi city and use stopovers and open jaws:</span> So if you fly from North America to Asia via Europe, you can actually take breaks in between.</li>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Mistake fares:</span> Mistakes Fares happen more often than not. You just have to be lucky to know about it at the right time. Last year a President Suite in Grand Hyatt, Santiago, Chile worth more than $1000 a night was available for $5 per night just because of a mistake fare. </li>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Flying budget airline:</span> Every country has some major carriers and some budget airlines like the US has Spirit, Frontier, etc. India has Indigo and others, Europe has EVO or something but most countries have budget airlines which offer way cheaper tickets but they charge you almost everything during the flight like checked bags, food, drinks, etc. But if you do things right, pack light, book earlier you can be saving lots and lots of money by doing this.</li>\n          </ol>\n          \n          Moving to Accomodation, which is the second thing people spend money on. To be honest, I spend the least amount of money on accommodations. So how do I do it?          \n          \n          <ul>\n            <li>I try to camp in most places which is way cheaper, if I don’t have a tent I will try to sleep in my car.  I have slept in my car in so many different countries. I know a lot of people will be shy of doing it but another option is renting an RV/ Camper van which saves you a lot of money as well.</li>\n            <li>o you might think, how do I camp in bigger cities? I book hotels or hostels which are way cheaper. If you are alone you can get by living in a cheap hostel but if you are with your partner/spouse you might want to book a fancy hotel. I definitely agree to that and I do it all the time. When I was in Paris a few months ago I stayed in pretty good hotels for free. How? Credit cards, so there are many credit cards that offer 1 free night every year as a part of their membership. I booked a hotel which was 250$ and the annual fee I paid was $49. You understand what I am trying to say here. There are so many hotel chains offering free nights and points, make use of them.</li>\n            <li>Mistake fares do apply on this too but it's rare and you need to be super aware.</li>\n          </ul>\n          Coming to car rentals, there are many ways you can make car rentals cheaper\n\n          <ul>\n            <li>First being, renting from a common carrier like Hertz, enterprise, sixt or someone else. Also enroll in their rewards program like I am enrolled in Hertz Gold and current I am a President Circle member so I get free upgrades to 2 levels, like if I rent regular Sedan like Camry or Sonata, I can pick up an AWD SUV for no extra charge also I save a lot of time during checkouts.</li>  \n            <li>Never buy insurance from car rental companies, use your credit card insurance. I use Chase Sapphire Reserve which offers pretty extensive insurance. I had a minor scratch on my car in the Europe trip on my tire and they charged me 1150 Euros for it but Chase covered it all.</li>\n            <li><span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Folks under 25:</span> Use USAA membership if you are in USA which will waive your Young Driver fees which are around $11 - $15 per day depending on the car rental company you choose. I have been renting cars since I was 19 and I haven’t paid a single penny for this useless fee.</li>\n            <li>Also folks in the US, you can use Costco for renting cars, they have good deals and offer free additional drivers.</li>\n          </ul>          \n          \n          \n          \n          <span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Food:</span> You can spend or save a lot of money on food but it solely depends on you. I would like to tell you what I do when I am travelling. I basically eat out once every day and my one meal outside will be in a place/cuisine which is that place known for in a more traditional restaurant depending on where I am. First thing I do is go to a grocery store and buy a lot of stuff depending on the days I am there. Like I will buy a lot of fruits and other healthy snacks or sandwiches or salads which I can basically eat while driving and will save me a lot of money. I also buy Oatmeal/porridges for breakfasts. If I am staying at a hotel I will take advantage of their free breakfast which most hotels provide.           \n          <br /><br />\n\n          <span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Miscellaneous:</span> There are a few things you really can’t save on like gas/petrol, tolls, fees for cable cars or gondolas, entrance fees. You can still save up on entrance fees like if you like travelling to national parks, you can buy a national park pass which is $80/year for 2 different people with unlimited entrees, compare that to $35/park for 1 car. I travelled to 14 national parks last year and it only cost me $80. Compare that to $35 per park which costs $490. So I saved around $410 for it. \n          <br /><br />\n\n          <span id=\"textSpan\" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Secret Tip:</span> Travel Smartly. If you are a regular traveller using a good premium travel credit card is a must. I use several of these and my favorite is Chase Sapphire Reserve. All these premium credit cards seem to be expensive at first but if you do the math, they save you way more than you can expect of it barring you travel. I pay $550 per year for my CSR but they give me $300 back every year, a priority pass, $120 Doordash credit, Lyft high end membership, total coverage on rental cars anywhere in the world, accidental protection on stuff, baggage insurance, flight insurance, no foriegn transaction fees and so much more that most people don’t think about. I am not trying to sell you this card but if you ask my honest opinion I will ask you to get this card if you travel often or want to travel more. Also there’s a sign up bonus. \n        Í\n        </p>\n          <Row>\n          <Col sm=\"6\" lg=\"4\">\n          <a href=\"/firstcard\"          \n          target=\"_blank\">\n          <img\n                alt=\"...\"\n                className=\"img-rounded img-no-padding img-responsive\"\n                src={require(\"assets/img/firstcard.jpg\")}\n                height='350px'\n                width='350px'\n              />\n             <h4 className=\"text-center\">Applying for your First Card</h4>\n          </a>\n          </Col>\n          <Col sm=\"6\" lg=\"4\">\n          <a href=\"/top10cards\"                 \n          target=\"_blank\">\n          <img\n                alt=\"...\"\n                className=\"img-rounded img-no-padding img-responsive\"\n                src={require(\"assets/img/credit.jpg\")}\n                height='350px'\n                width='350px'\n              />\n                <h4 className=\"text-center\">Top 10 Credit Cards</h4>\n          </a>\n          </Col>          \n          <Col sm=\"6\" lg=\"4\">\n          <a href=\"/battleofthebest\"          \n          target=\"_blank\">\n          <img\n                alt=\"...\"\n                className=\"img-rounded img-no-padding img-responsive\"\n                src={require(\"assets/img/top3.png\")}\n                height='350px'\n                width='350px'\n              />\n                <h4 className=\"text-center\">Best Travel Cards</h4>\n          </a>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        </Container>\n        <DemoFooter />\n        </>\n      );\n    }\n    \nexport default TravelSmarter;\n\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport { BrowserRouter, Route, Redirect, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\n// styles\nimport \"assets/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\nimport \"assets/scss/paper-kit.scss?v=1.2.0\";\nimport \"assets/demo/demo.css?v=1.2.0\";\n// pages\nimport Index from \"views/Index.js\";\nimport About from \"views/About.js\";\nimport Blog from \"views/Blog.js\";\nimport CreditAdvice from \"views/CreditAdvice.js\";\nimport DigitalNomad from \"views/DigitalNomad.js\";\nimport TravelBlog from \"views/TravelBlog.js\";\nimport TravelTips from \"views/TravelTips\";\nimport Hiking from \"views/Hiking\";\nimport Iceland from \"views/blog/Iceland\";\nimport Switzerland from \"views/blog/Switzerland\";\nimport Paris from \"views/blog/Paris\";\nimport ReactGA from \"react-ga\";\nimport FirstCard from \"views/FirstCard\";\nimport Top10Cards from \"views/Top10Cards\";\nimport BattleoftheBest from \"views/BattleoftheBest\";\nimport TravelSmarter from \"views/blog/TravelSmarter\";\n// others\n\nReactGA.initialize('UA-82402078-1');\nReactGA.pageview(window.location.pathname + window.location.search);\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <BrowserRouter>\n  \n    <Switch>\n      <Route path=\"/\" render={(props) => <Index {...props} />} />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/about\"\n        render={(props) => <About {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/blog\"\n        render={(props) => <Blog {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/creditadvice\"\n        render={(props) => <CreditAdvice {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/digitalnomad\"\n        render={(props) => <DigitalNomad {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/travelblog\"\n        render={(props) => <TravelBlog {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/traveltips\"\n        render={(props) => <TravelTips {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/hiking\"\n        render={(props) => <Hiking {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/iceland\"\n        render={(props) => <Iceland {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/switzerland\"\n        render={(props) => <Switzerland {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/paris\"\n        render={(props) => <Paris {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/firstcard\"\n        render={(props) => <FirstCard {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/top10cards\"\n        render={(props) => <Top10Cards {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/battleofthebest\"\n        render={(props) => <BattleoftheBest {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/travelsmarter\"\n        render={(props) => <TravelSmarter {...props} />}\n      />\n      <Redirect to=\"/\" />\n    </Switch>\n  </BrowserRouter>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
